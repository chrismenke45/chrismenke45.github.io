    experience: 'Since this app utulizes server-side rendering, I had to choose a templating language.  I had used Pug in the past but wanted to try something new.  I chose EJS because I had read it was a classic and easy to learn.  I do agree that it was easy to learn; however, I prefer Pug.  EJS felt like more work than normal HTML. On top of that it was visually unappealing and hard to debug. In the future I will try to avoid EJS as a templating language.  This app also taught me about authentication using Passport.js.',
