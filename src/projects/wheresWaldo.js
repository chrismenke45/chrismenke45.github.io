    description: "This project was made with Vanilla JavaScript and utilized Google Firebase as a Backend as a Service. In the webpage, a user can play a \"Where's Waldo?\" game with Pokémon. The game saves the users’ times and allows them to check others’ scores. There is optional use of Gmail authentication to autofill the user's name when submitting scores.",
    experience: 'This app was one of my first with a backend.  It allowed me to learn how to interact with a backend without worrying about making the backend functional.  It also provided me with the experience of learning to use "<map>" and "<area>" tags to set clickable areas in an image.',
