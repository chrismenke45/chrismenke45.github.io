    "My Twitter Clone was made with the MERN Stack and is composed of 2 sites: \
    a frontend hosted on Github Pages and an api hosted on Render.com. \
    It allows users to sign in with their Twitter credentials via Passport.js \
    and Twitter OAuth.  This imports and prepopulates their user profile with their \
    username and profile picture.  The user can then post on the clone with text or pictures, \
    follow other users, and explore tweets and profiles.  All Clone generated posts are kept \
    internal to the Twitter Clone.",

Once you get past the dangerous site warning, please wait a moment before attempting to log in with the twitter OAuth.
