    description: "My Instagram Clone was made with React.js, Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. It is composed of 2 sites: a frontend hosted on Github Pages and an api hosted on Fly.io.  It has all the functionality of instagram, including: posting, following, messaging, liking and commenting. The site has a guest profile that allows users to see it without setting up an account.",
    experience: 'This app allowed me to really cement my Ruby on Rails skills. It also gave me and opportunity to utilize the useContext and useReducer hooks in React for state management.',
